            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I am a Frontend Software Developer based in Berlin who is passionate about fixing our day to day problems
              by the applied use of Technology.
              Since more and more businesses are digitising their medium of communication with their customers, I
              understand the demand for the skills required and ready to take up the challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              My core skill sets are that I am a Quick Learner, Team-player and I am open to challenges. And my
              technical skills are HTML, CSS and JavaScript and their related frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey as a software developer started with self-learning on Freecodecamp. In order to bring more
              structure to my learning, I joined Digital Career Institute for the Full-stack Developer course.
              Freecodecamp and Digital Career Institute have accelerated this journey and I've been able to work on
              various software projects both independently and as part of the program.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although I worked in multiple domains, I have always looked for something interesting and challenging
              where I can use my skills to solve meaningful problems, learn from colleagues. I would define an Ideal
              working environment as a place where Sex, Race or Ethnicity does not matter, where I can be an Individual
              contributor as well as a Team player, Learn and contribute to the business goals.
